Clovis Thelexias is one of the executors of the Jedi Council. He is responsible for exploring the mysteries of the Milky Way, traveling and fighting in the darkness. His wisdom and power are impressive, and his legends are left in every corner of the galaxy. Neither the most ferocious interstellar bandits nor the domineering and ruthless Imperial Stormtroopers would like to mention his name.

He is the only remaining aristocrat among the galactic humans, with a hint of idealistic paranoia and madness. It reminds people of the characters in the knight novels of the Age of Discovery. 

“En un lugar de la Mancha, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme, no ha mucho tiempo que vivía un hidalgo de los de lanza en astillero, adarga antigua, rocín flaco y galgo corredor.”

He is known as the Galaxy Knight. Of course, it is said that the mysterious and powerful knight also plays video games in his spare time. His favorite is Cyberpunk 2077: Edgewalker. Maybe the heroine in it reminds him of an old friend.
